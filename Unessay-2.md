# A Day Without Technology as a Computer Scientist

I decided to do a more experiential approach for this unessay. When Professor Cordell mentioned that his first-year class had to experience a day without technology, I had trouble fathoming what a day like this entails. I'm a computer science major, what does a day without using my computer mean other than an unproductive day? So I decided to actually experience it.

## The Planning...
It's not so easy to just randomly choose a day to not use my computer or phone. I had three final projects due this week and two finals of which one is online. I finally decided to do this experiment on Saturday, April 21st. I would turn in one of my final projects on Friday. For the final test and final paper due on Sunday I'll finish the paper on Friday and submit that then take my final test Sunday morning. I won't procrastinate and it will all work out!

After deciding on a day, I sent a text to my family in case they couldn't reach me and get worried; I also sent a text to my boss just in case; then sent a few texts to my closest friends so they don't think I disappeared. I had to double and triple check that I had no real obligations or deadlines that day as I won't be able to check my calendar because every single event in my daily life is on my Google calendar.

This is both exciting and terrifying.

## The Day Before...
I was supposed to finish the paper on Friday and submit it but after taking another final I was too mentally exhausted. I started to panic a little bit as I wasn't sure if I'll have enough time to complete it on Sunday. So with every last bit of mental strength that I had, I sat down at my desk and cranked out the last part of the paper. I proofread the paper for any mistakes, and I submitted it! It was about 9 or 10pm by the time I finished. I turned off my phone, turned off my laptop, and started the day without technology early because why not? And I went to sleep.

## The Day Of...
Usually on weekends I set an alarm to wake up at a reasonable time so I get started on my day and get some work done. But that day I woke up naturally, it felt so wonderful. It's definitely one of the things that I never appreciated enough when I had the luxury to do so. Naturally I turned to my side and check the time on my phone, but of course, my phone is off! I dragged my half-asleep body out of bed and check the digital clock on my desk, it was around 10am, I slept so soundly! I went to get breakfast at the dining hall and like a lot of other people, I usually pull out my phone and go on Instagram to see some sports highlights or what other people are up to. Today I ate my breakfast in silence. Every few minutes I would try to pull out my phone to pass the time but I stayed strong.

I have a whole day ahead of me with no plans and no schoolwork to do. Well I do have schoolwork to do but I can't do any of it because I'm a computer science major and everything is online! It's both a blessing and a curse at times. I took the T down to Boston Common and decided to spend some time exploring the city on my own. On the T, I naturally pulled out my phone multiple times then saw that it was off and remembered that it's my no-technology day. Usually when I walk anywhere I have my headphones on either playing music or listening to podcasts. But since that would require the use of my phone, my T ride was instead filled with the rumble of the train.

I love Boston. The constant buzzing of energy; the small hint of Spring; the dichotomy between history and the future. Without my headphones, I was able to listen to the sound of people, the sound of the birds flapping, and the sound of nature. I didn't realize there was a sound associated to nature but there was and it was wonderful. I sat on a bench and people-watched. I saw kids running around without a care in the world. I saw couples strolling by, families spending quality time together. I saw so much joy and love.

I don't remember how long I spent on that bench but I remember walking away from that bench with a new sense of appreciation for the city and for the world. I decided to walk back to campus because it was nice out and I have nothing else to do. I walked by houses and stores, trees and flowers, bikes and cars. I went to the gym when I got back just to pass some more time. Then the rest of the night I spent it hanging out at the RA Staff Office to chat with residents and the RAs who were on duty.

It was a day balanced well with enough me-time and social time. Towards the end of the day I didn't even really check my phone. I was more present and more aware. I survived a day without technology.

## The Experience...
It was quite eye-opening and ear-opening to say the least. Without my headphones and constantly checking my phone whenever I get a moment alone, I was able to experience so much more of the world and everything around me. I would not say I'm the type of person who has to have her phone with her 24/7; however, I also can't deny that I'm on my phone a lot. It was definitely difficult to get through the day without worrying about completing my assignments for classes or feeling guilty about not being productive. I couldn't help but think about all the work I would've accomplished if I had my laptop. But in retrospect, it is also important to stop and smell the flowers as the famous saying goes. It is important to live in the moment. It is important to take a step back from drowning in work, and breathe in all the joy around you. It is important to spend time alone and let your mind wander. These are some experiences that technology has taken away from us. We begin to guide our senses inward towards that device, looking at pictures people post on Instagram and listening to music and reading the statuses on Facebook or commentaries on Reddit. Instead, once in a while, we should let those senses flow outward. See the beautiful architectures, the flowers, the sky. Hear the sound of the Charles River. Feel the heat on your skin as the sun shines or the numbness on your face as the cold wind blows. Experience all that. Because this is something that technology didn't change and can't change - the feeling of being completely present in the world, it's magical.
