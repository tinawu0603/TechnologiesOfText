# Technologies of Text
ENGL3340 Spring 2018 - Technologies of Text

## Course Description
In Technologies of Text we will develop ideas about the ways such innovations of new media technologies - e.g. moveable type, the steam press, the telegraph, radio, film, television, the internet - shape our understanding of classic and contemporary texts, as well as the people who write, read, and interpret them. We will compare our historical moment with previous periods of textual and technological upheaval. Many debates that seem to be unique to the twenty-first century - over privacy, intellectual property, information overload, and textual authority - are but new iterations of familiar battles in the histories of technology, new media, and literature. This semester we will get hands-on experience with textual technologies, new and old, through labs in letterpress printing, bibliography, digital editing, and computational text analysis.

## Lab Fieldbooks Descriptions

### Understanding Textual Structure with Markdown
Introduction to Markdown and the affordances and limitations with this new medium for writing.

### Visible Language
Through attentive looking, compare and contrast two distinct textual artifacts from two different ancient cultures in the Museum of Fine Arts Art of the Ancient World Collections. Speak about the mode of writing, analyze and interpret the similarities and differences, think through what they might tell us about the audiences, purposes, and meanings of writing in these different media, cultures, and time periods.

### Thinking with the Codex
Choose 3-4 specific pages from two books in the Northeastern University's Archives and Special Collections, the pair should illuminate a particular textual contrast: between times, technologies, or cultures. Analyze salient similarities and differences to understand significances. Think about shifts in practices, relationships among technology, media, and culture.

### Planning to Print
Through the process of letterpress - metal type, lead spacers, wood furniture, quoins, ink, and paper - each text requires planning and puzzling out a workable layout and imposition as well as balancing aesthetic ideals with practical exigencies. Reflect upon the experiences of textual production and trace the relationships throughout each step of the process.

### Pulling the Press
Why are people drawn to letterpress printing that is certainly slower than hitting "print" in a word processor?  Is it nostalgia? How does the current letterpress enthusiasm line up with history, and how does it depart - what do these overlaps and departures tell us about our own historical moment?

### Deciphering Physical Books - The Dictionary
Think about the *presence* of books in society, the functions they serve beyond reading and the ways their physical constructions can broadcast ideas about their contents and their readers. Choose a contemporary textual artifact and unpack its meaning. How does its format and the cultural ramifications of its format resemble historical-textual artifacts.

### RMarkdown
Ruminate on the R code and its relationship to some of the ideas in class readings. Think about the relationships among code, writing, and literary analysis.

### Computational Reading - Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling
Think through the potential and pitfalls of computational text analysis. What new possibilities do sentiment analysis and topic modeling open and how aspects of the texts may be obscured by such methods?

### Electronic Texts
Reflect upon electronic texts - not just confined in the realms of texts on screens, but through the lab's usage of conductive copper tape, coin cell batteries, LEDs, to create paper circuits.
