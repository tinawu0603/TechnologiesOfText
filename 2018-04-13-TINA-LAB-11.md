## Experience during the lab

I have a good amount of experience in circuits and microcontrollers, a mini-computer that can run code and connect cables into circuits. Seeing the LED lights and copper tapes take me back to high school when I used to be really involved in robotics and embedded systems. I built light-following robots, pressure-sensored lighting panels, and a myriad of other small projects; I was excited to play with circuits again.

When Professor Cordell started to explain the lab, I struggled finding something to make that was fun, doable in 30 minutes, and challenging enough to occupy me for 30 minutes. I began by sketching a few circuits to make a piano but could not come up with a way for the power to flow to other keys if the first key isn't pressed down. I did a few other sketches but every idea I came up with wouldn't have worked. I was frustrated and started looking up examples online - for guidance and for alternate inspirations. Then I looked over to my neighbor and she had this ingenious circuit design that will accomplish exactly what I was struggling with. I found my inspiration.

I began my piano design with just one LED light and a "switch" that connects the circuit when pressed down. After some sloppy copper taping and touching two ends of the copper tape to opposite sides of the battery, I saw my LED light up! I smiled and probably also cheered out loud at my simple achievement. I looked around at my mostly English majors classmates, and saw faces of confusion, frustration, but also joy. I couldn't help but begin to encourage more of them to like engineering, the road is rough but the satisfaction and sense of achievement at the end of the road is so wonderful.

## Reflections

When I hear the words "electronic texts" I see text messages on my phone, e-books on Kindles, and articles and websites on computer monitors. Even now after the lab I still have trouble thinking about electronic texts outside the realms of personal computing devices. I used to think computers and modern technology and English and classic literature are at two extremes. However, through this lab and the previous R programming labs, I've since begin to see that the two ends can be more similar than I thought.

When my classmate next to me began doing the circuit lab by putting some tapes on the paper without prior design or introspection of how everything will be put together, I realized this practice is similar to free-writing. In the past few years when I've written papers, I've always trained myself to start with an outline of topic sentences and concrete details to produce that standard 5-paragraph essay. But in retrospect, the times when I've truly enjoyed the act of writing is when I am able to freely let my thoughts flow on paper, or on screen. I thought of writing as a chore when I had to follow a set of rules and guidelines, when I was restricted in terms of creativity and my own personal style of writing. This was what drew me into engineering and technology in general. I love the limitless possibilities, the constant challenges, and the countless approaches to solve one problem. A lot of us in the classroom did simple circuits to make an LED light up, but no two circuits look exactly the same, each of us put our own style and vision into our projects.

It is bold to say that every programmer have a style as authors of literature do. Some authors are poets while others are novelists; some prefer long pieces of works made up of series or volumes while others prefer short stories. Each author has something personal to say through the content but also through the medium of his or her choice; the effects of using rhymes are different from the effects of using dual-perspective narratives. The exact same ideas are demonstrated in programming. Some programmers want their products to be more interactive with the audience while others choose to be more reserved; a programmer may choose to program a mobile application while another may want to build a web application - both seeking to accomplish the same end results of displaying information.

There are a lot of context surrounding texts and technologies. They are more than the robot itself and the words in a book. Technologies and texts are also about their origins, their reasons, and their effects. Why was this made this way? Why was this presented this way? Why was this created in the first place? A big part of this course throughout the semester has been to think about experiences in terms of experiences lost (composing type, ancient texts) to modern yet somewhat unknown experiences (computational linguistics, circuits). It has been so eye-opening to learn about how the old connects to the modern but also how the modern has remains of the old. It's been a pleasure this year in Technologies of Text.
